# RWM - Read With Meaning

This project is named RWM. It is a short form for 'Read With Meaning'.

The goal is to be able to read PDF documents (mainly books) within the browser, with meanings next to the difficult words.

I created this project for helping myself to be able to read with ease without keeping a dictionary open in hand or in another tab/software.
